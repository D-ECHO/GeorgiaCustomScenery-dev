## Georgia Custom Scenery by Sam Figaro (Figaro) and Benedikt Wolf (D-ECHO)

This repository includes the scripts and data that was used for generating the "Georgia Custom Scenery". data/SRTM-1 and the work*/ folders as well as some OSM landcover .dbf files are not included for file size reasons, but they can be generated using the scripts given here or by splitting data available from the links below.

Following sources have been used:

* SRTM-1 global elevation data from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/ 
* Landcover Data from VMAP0 by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency from https://gis-lab.info/qa/vmap0-eng.html
* Landcover Data from https://www.openstreetmap.org/export, http://download.geofabrik.de and https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html under ODbL 1.0
* Airport Data from https://gateway.x-plane.com and manually edited by Sam Figaro and Benedikt Wolf
* Objects from FlightGear's terrasync (see scenery.flightgear.org)

Thanks to _laserman_ for scripts to process airport data files into groundnets (https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools)!
